  <strong>Exploring the future of autonomous AI agents powered by Google Cloud and Vertex AI</strong>
</p>

## Motivation

The emergence of **agentic AI** marks a paradigm shift from reactive AI models to autonomous systems capable of proactive decision-making, planning, and acting within dynamic environments. With the **Google Agent Development Kit (GDK)**, developers now have a powerful framework to build, orchestrate, and scale intelligent agents that can:

- Reason over structured and unstructured data
- Utilize tools and APIs through planning and execution
- Learn from context and feedback
- Perform complex multi-step tasks autonomously

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with **agent development** using GDK in the Google Cloud ecosystem, which offers seamless integration with large language models, embeddings, vector search, and more.


## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Google Cloud SDK
- Access to the Google Agent Development Kit (Preview/Beta)

## Learning Goals

- Understand how agentic architectures differ from traditional LLM pipelines
- Explore how plans, steps, and tools work in the GDK framework
- Develop agents that can autonomously interact with the environment

## Resources

- [Google Agent Development Kit Documentation](https://developers.google.com/agent-development-kit)
- [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)
- [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
